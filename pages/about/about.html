    <main>
        <p>I usually find myself drawn to the aesthetic, even if it’s one that is abstract and unique. I love developing ideas into strong visuals that have a strong concept-lead in throughout their design.
            <br>
            I’m very concept driven in my approach to aesthetic. I like media with strong themes throughout and have always been inspired by it.
            <br>
            I’m a big believer in using collaboration to enhance and develop ideas, and don’t believe that one mind’s singular idea and talents will create the best work possible. I find that bouncing ideas off other people and trusting in their skills always helps to further the vision beyond anything that has been thought of before.
            <br>
            I find myself evolving through both inspirational draws - whenever some new piece of media catches my eye, I think of how I would create for that concept/vision and envision my version of the media in creation. This allows me to evolve as I am exposed to new concepts and aesthetics before using them to broaden my imagination.</p>
