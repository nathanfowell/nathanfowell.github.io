                <h2>51 Studio</h2>
                <p>A personal favourite project of mine was this project for UTC Plymouth while I was an intern at 51 Studio, an advertising agency based in Plymouth. <br> Reimagining logo variations and creating a poster for the client within the constraints of the brand's identity regarding font, style and theme was a great creative exercise, giving me my first experience with Adobe Illustrator and sparking a love for the busy atmosphere of a creative agency.</p>

                <p>The assignment here was to redesign handouts which the university could use on their open days for their design-based course.
                    This was one of my first independently led live client projects and was a great basis for understanding briefs, pitching, receiving client feedback and delivering content as promised.</p>

                <p>A small design that was used as artwork to accompany an original podcast idea in my first year of university.
                    The irreverant title reflects the tone of the podcast: an off the cuff, agony aunt style show that seeked to make the listener laugh just as much as answer their questions.</p>

                <p>Some of my first work with Adobe Photoshop during A-Levels. My assingment was to create a poster from an original film concept.
                    I was able to incorperate some flair into this horror-comedy idea while exercising technical ability in both photography and design skills.</p>
