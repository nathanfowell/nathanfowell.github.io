                <h2>51 Studio</h2>
                <p>A personal favourite project of mine was this project for UTC Plymouth while I was an intern at 51 Studio, an advertising agency based in Plymouth. <br> Reimagining logo variations and creating a poster for the client within the constraints of the brand's identity regarding font, style and theme was a great creative exercise, giving me my first experience with Adobe Illustrator and sparking a love for the busy atmosphere of a creative agency.</p>

                <p>The assignment here was to redesign handouts which the university could use on their open days for their design-based course. <br> This was one of my first independently led live client projects and was a great basis for understanding briefs, pitching, receiving client feedback and delivering content as promised.</p>

                <p>Some of my first work with Adobe Photoshop, our assingment was to create a poster from an original film concept. <br> I was able to incorperate some flair into this horror-comedy idea while exercising technical ability in both photography and design.</p>
